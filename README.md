# Horiseon-Refactor

##Description
Refactoring code to optimize for accessibility.
I did this project to learn about accessibiity and to practice the basic HTML and CSS skills I'm currently learning.
While working on this project I began to see more patterns inherent in the coding languages we're learning.
